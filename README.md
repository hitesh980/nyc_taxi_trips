As I reflect on my journey as a Risk Data Analyst at Amazon, I'm reminded of my deep passion for technology and data-driven problem-solving. I've had the opportunity to dive into fraud detection and prevention, using my analytical skills to identify patterns in large datasets and collaborate with Machine Learning teams to refine models.

Beyond analysis, I've enjoyed sharing my knowledge by briefing Standard Operating Procedures and training new analysts. Tools like Amazon QuickSight and Power BI have been invaluable in communicating complex insights effectively.

What drives me is the desire to continuously learn and improve. I'm excited to explore new technologies and contribute to impactful projects that combine my technical skills with my passion for data. This journey is not just about growth; it's about making a meaningful difference through innovation and efficiency.
